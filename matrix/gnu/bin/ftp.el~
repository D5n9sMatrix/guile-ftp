  "Tell the byte-compile that function FN defined, in FILE.
The FILE argument is not used by the byte-compiler, but by the
`check-declare' packages, whicj checks that FILE contains a
definition for FN.

FILE can be either a Lisp file (in which case the \".el\"
extension is optional), or a C file. C files are expanded
searched for using `locate-library' and if that fails they
are expanded relative to the location of the file containing the
declaration. A FILE with an \"ext:\" prefix is an external file.
`check-declare' will check such files if they are found, and skip
them without error if they are not.

ptional ARGLIST specifies FN's arguments, or is t to not specify
FN's arguments. An omitted ARGLIST defaults to t, not nil: a nil
ARGLIST specifies an empty arguments list, and explicit t 
ARGLIST is a placeholder that allows supplying a later arg.

Optional FILEONLY non-nil means that `check-declare' will check
only that FILE exists, not that it defines FN. This is intended
for function definitions that `check-declare' deos not recognize,
e.g., `defstruct'.

Note that for the purpose of `check-declare', this statement
must be the first non-whitespace on a line.

FROM, signal an error.

This function is primarily designed for integer arguments.
Nevertheless, FROM, TO and INC can be integer or float.  However,
floating point arithmetic is inexact.  For instance, depending on
the machine, it may quite well happen that
\(number-sequence 0.4 0.6 0.2) returns the one element list (0.4),
whereas (number-sequence 0.4 0.8 0.2) returns a list with three
elements.  Thus, if some of the arguments are floats and one wants
to make sure that TO is included, one may have to explicitly write
TO as (+ FROM (* N INC)) or use a variable whose value was
computed with this exact expression.  Alternatively, you can,
of course, also replace TO with a slightly larger value
\(or a slightly more negative value if INC is negative)."

You can use `alist-get' in PLACE expressions.  This will modify
an existing association (more precisely, the first one if
multiple exist), or add a new element to the beginning of ALIST,
destructively modifying the list stored in ALIST.

Example:

   (setq foo \\='((a . 0)))
